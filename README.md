# Gallium.jl is now deprecated. The following Julia debuggers are actively maintained:

- [Juno](https://junolab.org) - the official integrated development environment (IDE) for the Julia language 
- [Debugger.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDebug/Debugger.jl) - the official Julia debugger
- [Rebugger.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Rebugger.jl) - an expression-level debugger for Julia with a provocative command-line (REPL) user interface
- [MagneticReadHead.jl](https://github.com/oxinabox/MagneticReadHead.jl) - a powerful Julia debugger based on [Cassette.jl](https://github.com/jrevels/Cassette.jl)
- [Infiltrator.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDebug/Infiltrator.jl) - allows you to set a breakpoint in a local context, inspect local variables and the call stack, and execute arbitrary statements in the context of the current function's module

You might also enjoy:

- [Traceur.jl](https://github.com/JunoLab/Traceur.jl) - runs your code and tells you about any obvious performance traps
